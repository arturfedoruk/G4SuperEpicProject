# G4SuperEpicProject

This is my project on **Geant4** I made while being 3rd year MIPT student.

It calculates number of neutrons that an electron beats out of tugsten target, depending of energy of the electron, and comparing physics lists `QGSP_BERT` and `QGSP_BERT_HP`.

It's basically `exampleB4a` with geometry from `exampleB2a` and some my minor aditional stuff for the purpose of my task.

Running this script is the same as running all Geant4 examples, see `READMEHowToRun` in Geant4 files (`/examples` folder).
